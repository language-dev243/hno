# Step-by-Step Blueprint for "hno"

## 1. Initial Project Setup

- Initialize the project with Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React Query.
- Set up a basic folder structure for components, hooks, and utilities.
- Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript for best practices.
- Implement a simple home page with a placeholder header.

## 2. Basic Routing and Layout

- Set up React Router for navigation.
- Implement a basic layout with a `Header` component.
- Configure a route for the main story feed.
- Add a placeholder for modal navigation for story details.

## 3. Fetch and Display Stories

- Integrate React Query for API calls.
- Fetch and display a list of stories from the Hacker News API.
- Implement pagination (20 stories per page) with filtering options.
- Ensure proper error handling with error popups.

## 4. Implement Story Modal

- Create a `StoryModal` component that opens when a story is clicked.
- Fetch and display full story details in the modal.
- Implement smooth transitions for opening and closing the modal.

## 5. Fetch and Display Comments

- Implement a `Comment` component to display nested comments.
- Load only initially visible comments first.
- Fetch remaining comments in the background for a smoother experience.
- Implement indentation and vertical lines for nested comments.

## 6. Dark/Light Mode Support

- Implement a system to detect and apply system preference on load.
- Add a toggle button in the `Header` for manual switching.
- Store preference in local storage for persistence.

## 7. Error Handling and Notifications

- Implement a global error-handling mechanism.
- Show errors as dismissible popups that disappear after a few seconds.
- Ensure error messages are meaningful and provide user feedback.

## 8. Improve UI/UX

- Add animations and transitions for modals and popups.
- Optimize layout for mobile responsiveness.
- Improve typography and spacing for readability.

## 9. Unit and Integration Testing

- Write unit tests for all core components (`StoryFeed`, `StoryItem`, `StoryModal`, `Comment`).
- Test API integration and data fetching with React Query.
- Ensure the pagination and filtering logic works correctly.

## 10. End-to-End Testing

- Use Cypress or Playwright to simulate real user interactions.
- Test navigation, filtering, modals, and error handling.
- Ensure dark/light mode toggles correctly.

## 11. Deployment and Optimization

- Optimize performance with lazy loading and caching.
- Deploy the app using Vercel or Netlify.
- Monitor performance and errors in production.
